Set 7
1. There are five methods implemented in Critter : getActors, processActors, 
getMoveLocations, selectMoveLocations, and makeMove
2. There are five actions that every critter does, all corresponding to the 
previous methods. Firstly, it gets a list of actors to process, then processes 
the actors, then generates a set of locations to which they may move, selects 
a move location, and then moves to that location
3.They should not override the getActors method, as the method would have the
exact same use in every single possible critter class, it would only need to be
changed if the environment was changed.
4.One way is the critter could "eat" the actors. Another way is it could simply
move the actors. A third way is that the critter could change the properties of
the actors, color etc.
5.The three methods needed ot make a critter move are: getMoveLocations(), which
returns all possible movements an actor could make. The second method, selectMove-
Locations() selects one of the suitable locations from getMoveLocations. The third
method, makeMove, processes the move and makes it happen.
6.There is no Critter constructor because it inherits the construcotr from Actor
because the class extends Actor. Any instance of critter will just call the super() method and call the constructor of Actor
