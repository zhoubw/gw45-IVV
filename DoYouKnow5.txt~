1. Interface Grid<E> implements. Both BoundedGrid and UnboundedGrid implement
the isValid method.
2.In Abstract Class AbstractGrid the method getValidAdjacentLocations uses
the method isValid. Other methods call getValidAdjacentLocations which
indirectly calls the isValid method.
3. get is called, getOccupiedAdjacentLocations is called. The latter also calls
isValid. The get method is in both the UnboundedGrid class and BoundedGrid 
class.
4.The method works by testing if the location of neighborLoc is null. No matter 
what type get returns, the method only cares if it is null. Then it adds the 
loc to an arraylist of locations and returns the arraylist, regardless of what
get returned.
5.It would only check for four different locations around the location instead
